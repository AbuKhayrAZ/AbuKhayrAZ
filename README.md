I am a Detail-Oriented Data Analyst specializing in end-to-end data pipeline management, from complex cleaning to dynamic reporting. With a foundation in Medical Biochemistry, I bring a unique, research-driven rigor to every dataset, ensuring accuracy and challenging assumptions to deliver reliable insights.

My primary goal is to empower organizations with clear, concise, and data-driven decision-making. I leverage SQL for robust data extraction and manipulation, Python (Pandas) for deep-dive analysis, and Power BI to architect executive-level dashboards that reveal hidden trends and optimize operations.
